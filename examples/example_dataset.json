    "source": "Recent studies in climate science indicate that global temperatures have risen by 1.2°C since pre-industrial times, primarily due to greenhouse gas emissions from human activities. The Arctic region has experienced the most dramatic changes, with ice coverage declining at a rate of 13% per decade. Scientists warn that without immediate action to reduce carbon emissions, the planet could face irreversible damage within the next 30 years. The Paris Agreement aims to limit warming to 1.5°C, but current policies fall short of this target. Renewable energy adoption has increased, but fossil fuels still account for 80% of global energy consumption.",
